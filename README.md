Worked with a team to create a more advanced version of the original homebrew app. Used Flutter(framework), Dart(programming language) and Visual Studio Code(code editor). Figma link and Jira link below. Jira software is what we used as a team to coordinate and set up tasks for each of us to complete within a given timeframe.
